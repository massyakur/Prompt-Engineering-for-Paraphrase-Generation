# Prompt Engineering for Paraphrase Generation

This repository contains the code, data, and results of our study on the use of prompt engineering to enhance the paraphrase generation capabilities of AI chatbots. Our work was presented at [8 th International Conference on Computer Science and Engineering UBMK 2023](https://ubmk.org.tr/).

## Overview

In this study, we explored the potential of prompt engineering as a tool for improving the quality of paraphrases generated by AI models. We conducted a comprehensive comparison of the performance of three popular chatbots—ChatGPT, Bing Chat, and BARD—using carefully crafted prompts. Our findings shed light on the potential of prompt engineering as a tool for improving chatbot communication and contribute to the ongoing efforts to make AI more useful and accessible.
